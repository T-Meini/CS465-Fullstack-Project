# CS-465 Fullstack Project

## Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
In the full stack project, Express HTML was used for server-rendered pages, which means that the server sends complete HTML documents to the client, causing the entire page to reload on navigation. JavaScript, on the other hand, was used to help with the interactivity and dynamic content of the web pages by manipulating the DOM and handling asynchronous requests without requiring a full-page reload. A Single-Page Application (SPA) was used to load a single HTML page and dynamically update its content as the user (me) interacted with the application. This approach provided a more smoother and faster user experience (UX) by reducing the need for full-page reloads.

## Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
The backend utilized MongoDB, a NoSQL database, because it offers flexibility in handling unstructured or semi-structured data and can scale horizontally to accommodate large amounts of data. Unlike traditional SQL databases that use structured tables, MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents, which goes well with the JavaScript and JSON formats that was used in this project, which made it easier to integrate with the application's data requirements.

## How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
JSON is a lightweight data interchange format that is both easy for people to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is mostly used for exchanging data between the client and server. In contrast, JavaScript is a programming language that is  used for adding interactivity and dynamic features to web pages. While JavaScript can work with JSON data, it is more complex and versatile. JSON ties frontend and backend development together by serving as a common format for data exchange, allowing the frontend to receive and display data from the backend.

## Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.
Refactoring was performed to enhance functionality and efficiency by breaking down complex functions into smaller, more manageable pieces, which improved code readability and maintainability. Reusable UI components offered significant benefits, including maintaining consistency throughout the application, speeding up development by reducing code duplication, and creating easier updates and scalability by allowing components to be reused and modified as needed.

## Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
In API testing, methods refer to the different HTTP actions like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE that are used to request and send data between the client and server. Endpoints are specific URLs within an API that represent various resources or actions. Security in API testing involves implementing measures such as authentication, authorization, and encryption to protect data and ensure that only authorized users can access certain resources. Testing APIs involves verifying that endpoints function correctly and securely, especially with added layers of security like OAuth or JWT, to handle various scenarios and potential vulnerabilities effectively.

## How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
This course has significantly advanced my professional skills by providing hands-on experience with full stack development, covering both frontend and backend technologies. I have developed a better understanding of API integration, including methods and security practices, and gained knowledge in managing NoSQL databases like MongoDB. The course also helped with my ability to refactor code for better performance and maintainability and to create reusable UI components, which improves consistency and efficiency. These skills collectively make me a more marketable candidate by showcasing my knowledge of modern web development practices and tools.
